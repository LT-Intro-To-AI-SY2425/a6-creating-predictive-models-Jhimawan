# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
0.86. This means I am getting closer for my line to become better and better predictions.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
My model is more accurate because I am achieving a better R-squared value.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?


4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
Since it is linearly going negative. At a certain point, it won't stop at 0 like it should but will follow the graph.
