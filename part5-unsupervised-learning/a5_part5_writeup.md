# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
top left - crazy spenders; make little, spend alot
bottom left - poor spenders; make very little and spend around that amount aka no saving
center - paycheck to paycheck spenders; spend as much as they make
top right - livin on the edge spenders; make an amount and spend just a little above that amount
bottom - hoarders; make alot, spend litter

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
most directly be associated with the bottom left group but realistically be in it's own group between between the bottom left and right groups.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
hoarders. A marketing team can shoot prices up and discount them at "50%" or "75%" sale when in reality it is not on sale and just marked up to look like it.
