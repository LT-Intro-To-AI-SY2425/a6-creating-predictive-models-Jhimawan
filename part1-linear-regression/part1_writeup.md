# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is .6257. This means it is close to being what the perfect line would be.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
137 mm Hg

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think this model's prediction is somewhat accurate. I do not  think it is able to reliably predict because there are no other factors being accounted in like situation or possible outliers affect bpm.
