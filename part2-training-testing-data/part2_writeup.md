# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
it is able to be validated with the trained numbers and then tested using the other ones.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells me how accuarte my line of best fit is.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I think my model is somewhat inaccurate because after age 65, they should be trying to a achieve a blood pressure of less than 130 but they clearly go way over even before age 65.
